# History View Implementation Tasks

## 1. Screen & Layout  
- [ ] Create `HistoryView` (SwiftUI or UIKit)  
  - [ ] Add a ‚Äúüî• Streak: X days‚Äù label at the top  
  - [ ] Add a monthly calendar grid beneath the streak label  
  - [ ] Implement a drill-down detail panel (modal or bottom sheet) for tapped dates  

## 2. Calendar Display  
- [ ] Render calendar for the current month  
  - [ ] Highlight days with logged workouts using a subtle dot or underline  
  - [ ] Disable navigation past available history range  
- [ ] Add controls to navigate to previous/next month  

## 3. Streak Indicator  
- [ ] In `HistoryViewModel`, compute `streakCount` by inspecting consecutive `PerformedWorkout` dates  
- [ ] Bind `streakCount` to the streak label in the view  
- [ ] Ensure the streak updates in real time when new workouts are logged  

## 4. Plan Progress Tracking  
- [ ] In `HistoryViewModel`, detect when a `PerformedWorkout` belongs to a multi-week plan  
- [ ] Compute `currentWeek = floor((date ‚Äì planStartDate)/7) + 1`, capped at total plan weeks  
- [ ] Expose `planWeekStatus` (currentWeek, totalWeeks) for the selected date  
- [ ] In the drill-down panel, display ‚ÄúWeek Y of Z‚Äù for plan entries  

## 5. Date Drill-Down Details  
- [ ] Add tap gesture to calendar cells  
- [ ] On tap of a marked day, fetch `PerformedWorkout` entries for that date  
- [ ] Present drill-down panel listing each workout:  
  - [ ] Workout name  
  - [ ] Total volume (Œ£ sets √ó reps √ó weight)  
  - [ ] **If part of a plan:** ‚ÄúWeek Y of Z‚Äù  
- [ ] Under each workout, list exercises with:  
  - [ ] Exercise name  
  - [ ] Total volume  
  - [ ] Body Weight  

## 6. Volume Calculations  
- [ ] In `HistoryViewModel`, check if you have the necessary columns for Total Volume to decide if you need to implement  
- [ ] Ensure calculations are efficient and cached where appropriate  

## 7. Template Usage Count (Stretch)  
- [ ] In `HistoryViewModel`, count persisted `PerformedWorkout` entries per template ID  
- [ ] Expose `templateUsageCounts: [TemplateID: Int]`  
- [ ] In drill-down panel (or hover), display ‚ÄúLogged N times‚Äù badge for each template  

## 8. Persistence & Data Flow  
- [ ] Fetch history from SwiftData/Core Data `PerformedWorkout` and `PerformedExercise` entities  
- [ ] Cache adjacent months‚Äô data in memory for smooth scrolling  
- [ ] Invalidate cache when new workouts are logged  

## 9. Error Handling & Empty States  
- [ ] If no workouts exist for the displayed month, show ‚ÄúNo workouts logged yet‚Äù placeholder  
- [ ] On data-fetch failure, show inline error message with a **Retry** button  
- [ ] Handle edge cases: corrupted entries, missing relationships  

## 10. Testing  
- [ ] **Unit tests** for `HistoryViewModel`:  
  - [ ] `streakCount` calculation for various date sequences  
  - [ ] Volume computations (exercise and workout)  
  - [ ] `planWeekStatus` logic for plan and non-plan workouts  
  - [ ] Template usage count aggregation  
- [ ] **UI tests** (optional but recommended):  
  - [ ] Verify calendar dots appear on correct dates  
  - [ ] Tap a date and assert drill-down contents match persisted data  
  - [ ] Assert streak label updates after a new workout is added  
  - [ ] Simulate fetch failures and empty-state display  

## 11. QA & Manual Validation  
- [ ] On device, verify calendar navigation and marking accuracy  
- [ ] Confirm streak count matches consecutive workout days  
- [ ] Tap several dates to validate drill-down details, including plan progress labels  
- [ ] Test error and empty states by clearing history or mocking failures  
- [ ] Gather feedback on layout clarity and minimalist styling
