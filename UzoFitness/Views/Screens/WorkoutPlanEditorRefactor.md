üìÑ PRD: Workout Template Editor Redesign

1. Overview

This feature revamps the Workout Template Editor to support faster workout creation and a cleaner, more intuitive UI. It adopts a vertical scroll layout showing all days, supports inline editing, rest day toggles, and multi-exercise additions‚Äîoptimized for minimalist design and thumb-friendly iOS interaction.

‚∏ª

2. Goals
	‚Ä¢	Create an intuitive, single-screen interface for managing a full workout template.
	‚Ä¢	Allow inline editing of days, exercises, and rest states without navigating away.
	‚Ä¢	Support multi-select exercise additions.
	‚Ä¢	Eliminate friction and clutter through minimalist layout and smooth transitions.

‚∏ª

3. User Stories
	‚Ä¢	As a user, I want to quickly see and edit my workout plan without tapping into separate screens, so I can stay focused.
	‚Ä¢	As a user, I want to toggle a workout day as a Rest Day so that I don‚Äôt have to delete exercises manually.
	‚Ä¢	As a user, I want to add multiple exercises at once to speed up workout creation.
	‚Ä¢	As a user, I want to reorder or remove exercises easily to keep my plan flexible.

‚∏ª

4. Functional Requirements

4.1 Workout Header
	‚Ä¢	The editor screen must include editable fields:
	‚Ä¢	Workout Name (non-empty, unique)
	‚Ä¢	Description (optional)
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúCancel‚Äù and ‚ÄúSave‚Äù buttons must be pinned to the top navigation bar.

4.2 Day Template Display
	‚Ä¢	Each day should display:
	‚Ä¢	Weekday label (e.g., ‚ÄúMonday‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Rest Day toggle aligned to the right
	‚Ä¢	A container stack of exercise rows (if not a rest day)
	‚Ä¢	An optional Notes field (inline text editor)
	‚Ä¢	Exercise rows must show:
	‚Ä¢	Exercise name
	‚Ä¢	Summary of sets x reps
	‚Ä¢	Pencil/edit icon on right side
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Swipe to delete or context menu for reordering
	‚Ä¢	A visible ‚ÄúAdd Exercise‚Äù button must appear below exercise rows (if isRest == false).

4.3 Rest Day Toggle Behavior
	‚Ä¢	Toggling the switch ON sets isRest = true:
	‚Ä¢	Hide all exercise rows and Add Exercise button.
	‚Ä¢	Replace with ‚ÄúRest Day‚Äù label (visually muted).
	‚Ä¢	Toggling OFF restores previously added exercises.
	‚Ä¢	On first toggle ON only, show confirmation alert:
	‚Ä¢	Title: ‚ÄúMark as Rest Day?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Message: ‚ÄúThis will hide all exercises for this day. You can toggle again to bring them back.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Buttons: ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù (confirm), ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù (revert toggle)

4.4 Add Exercise Flow
	‚Ä¢	Tap on ‚ÄúAdd Exercise‚Äù opens a modal or sheet with:
	‚Ä¢	Scrollable list of all available exercises
	‚Ä¢	Checkmark-based multi-select capability
	‚Ä¢	After confirmation:
	‚Ä¢	All selected exercises are appended to the day‚Äôs exerciseTemplates
	‚Ä¢	Each row appears with default values (e.g., 3 sets √ó 8 reps)

4.5 Add Day Functionality
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúAdd Day‚Äù button appears at the bottom of the screen.
	‚Ä¢	Adds a new day to the plan (defaults to next available weekday).
	‚Ä¢	Newly added day includes:
	‚Ä¢	Editable weekday (e.g., via picker or automatically sequential)
	‚Ä¢	Rest Day toggle, Notes field, and empty exercise list

4.6 Editing Exercises
	‚Ä¢	Tapping the pencil icon opens an inline or modal editor:
	‚Ä¢	Set count (stepper)
	‚Ä¢	Reps (stepper)
	‚Ä¢	Weight (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Rest (slider or text field)
	‚Ä¢	All inputs must update the ExerciseTemplate immediately on save.

‚∏ª

5. Visual Design Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Use .systemGray6 for section backgrounds and separation.
	‚Ä¢	Exercise rows and day sections must have at least 16px vertical spacing.
	‚Ä¢	All text must use system fonts (San Francisco) with clear weight/size hierarchy.
	‚Ä¢	Icons must use SF Symbols only.
	‚Ä¢	Card corners: cornerRadius = 12-16.
	‚Ä¢	No unnecessary shadows, borders, or gradients.
	‚Ä¢	Transitions should use default SwiftUI .transition(.opacity.combined(with: .move)) where needed.

‚∏ª

6. Non-Goals
	‚Ä¢	No superset grouping or drag-and-drop reordering in this version.
	‚Ä¢	No support for advanced programming logic (e.g., alternating days, progressions).
