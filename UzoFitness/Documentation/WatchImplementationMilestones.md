## Critical Issue Resolution ✅

### SwiftData ID Access Safety Implementation

**Problem Identified**: Critical runtime crashes when accessing SwiftData model IDs before ModelContext insertion  
**Root Cause**: `WorkoutPlan.id.getter` crashes when called before object persistence  
**Impact**: App crashes during workout plan operations

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **Object Identity Comparisons**: Replaced `plan.id == other.id` with `plan === other` for safe comparison
- ✅ **Deferred ID Access**: Moved all ID access to occur only after `modelContext.save()` completion
- ✅ **Safe Filtering Logic**: Used `contains(where:)` with object pointers instead of ID-based predicates
- ✅ **Error Boundaries**: Added proper error handling around remaining ID access points

**Files Updated**:
- `UzoFitness/ViewModels/LoggingViewModel.swift`: Comprehensive safety improvements
- `UzoFitness/ViewModels/LibraryViewModel.swift`: Safe ID access after persistence
- All ViewModels: Systematic review and safety implementation

**Validation**: Both iPhone and Watch apps launch and operate successfully on paired simulator
