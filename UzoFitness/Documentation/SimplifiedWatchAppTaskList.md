## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Principles
- **Minimalist**: Focus on essential information only
- **Functional**: Quick access to set completion and timer
- **Glanceable**: Large fonts, clear layout for quick reading
- **Haptic**: Rich haptic feedback for all interactions

### Data Flow
1. iOS app writes workout state to App Groups
2. Watch app reads from App Groups to display current state
3. Watch app writes set completions to App Groups
4. iOS app reads from App Groups to update its state

### Technical Architecture
- **Shared Code**: Use UzoFitnessCore for models and utilities
- **App Groups**: Use UserDefaults with App Groups for state sync
- **MVVM**: Follow MVVM pattern for watch app ViewModels
- **SwiftUI**: Use SwiftUI for all watch app views
