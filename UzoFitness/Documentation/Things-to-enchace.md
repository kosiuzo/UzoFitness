* [ ] **2.2** Remove the "History" title from the top.
* [ ] **2.3** Shift calendar UI component upward to allocate sufficient space for workout details below.
* [ ] **2.4** Adjust calendar sizing and spacing to ensure clear visibility of workout details and calendar simultaneously.
* [ ] **2.5** Update or add new unit tests covering these UI adjustments.

### 3.0 Optimize Data Consistency and Filtering

* [ ] **3.1** Review existing data filtering logic for unnecessary or unintended filtering of exercises.
* [ ] **3.2** Simplify the filtering logic to ensure all logged exercises, including incomplete sets, are accurately displayed.
* [ ] **3.3** Verify comprehensive display of logged workout details without data omissions.
* [ ] **3.4** Update unit tests ensuring data consistency and accuracy in the displayed results.

### 4.0 Improve Progress View

### 6.0 Enable Angle Group Swiping

* [ ] **6.1** Group progress images by photo angle (front, side, back).
* [ ] **6.2** Implement horizontal swiping to seamlessly navigate through images within each angle group.
* [ ] **6.3** Validate swiping transitions to ensure they are smooth and intuitive.
* [ ] **6.4** Add or enhance unit tests specifically targeting the angle group swiping functionality.

## Notes

* Follow minimalist design guidelines strictly, ensuring every UI change reduces complexity and visual noise.
* Consistently run unit tests using:

  ```
  xcodebuild -scheme MyFitnessApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.5' build
  ```
* Thoroughly test functionality via the Xcode simulator and TestFlight releases.
