# WatchOS Connectivity Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the UzoFitness watchOS companion app connectivity features. The watchOS app uses WatchConnectivity framework to maintain real-time synchronization with the iPhone app for workout data, timer states, and progress tracking.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- Physical iPhone (iOS 17.0+) OR iPhone Simulator
- Physical Apple Watch (watchOS 10.0+) OR Watch Simulator paired with iPhone
- Recommended: iPhone 16 Pro paired with Apple Watch Series 7 (45mm) via simulator

### Software Requirements
- Xcode 15.4+
- Both iPhone and Watch apps installed and signed properly
- App Group entitlement: `group.com.kosiuzodinma.UzoFitness`

## Testing Environment Setup

### Simulator Setup
1. Open Xcode and select "iPhone 16 Pro" simulator
2. Ensure Apple Watch Series 7 (45mm) is paired in simulator
3. Build and install both targets:
   ```bash
   # Build iPhone app
   xcodebuild -scheme UzoFitness -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro,OS=18.5' build
   
   # Build Watch app  
   xcodebuild -scheme "UzoFitnessWatch Watch App" -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 7 (45mm),OS=11.5' build
   ```

### Physical Device Setup
1. Install iPhone app via Xcode or TestFlight
2. Install Watch app (automatically installs with iPhone app)
3. Ensure both devices are unlocked and nearby
4. Verify Watch app appears on Watch home screen

## Core Connectivity Tests

### Test 1: Basic Connection Validation

**Objective**: Verify WatchConnectivity session activation and pairing

**Steps**:
1. Launch iPhone app
2. Launch Watch app
3. Observe connection status in both apps
4. Check logs for activation messages

**Expected Results**:
- Both apps show "Connected" status
- Console logs show: `[WatchConnectivityManager] Session activated successfully`
- No error messages in logs

**Validation Commands**:
```swift
// In SyncCoordinator
func validateConnection() -> Bool {
    let isSessionSupported = watchConnectivity.isSessionSupported
    let isReachable = watchConnectivity.isReachable  
    let isWatchAppInstalled = watchConnectivity.isWatchAppInstalled
    return isSessionSupported && isReachable && isWatchAppInstalled
}
```

### Test 2: Test Message Exchange

**Objective**: Verify bidirectional message passing

**iPhone Steps**:
1. Navigate to workout logging screen
2. Trigger test message from debug menu (if available) or via code:
   ```swift
   SyncCoordinator.shared.sendTestMessage()
   ```

**Watch Steps**:
1. Open watch app
2. Verify test message received
3. Check for automatic response message

**Expected Results**:
- iPhone sends: `"Test connection from iPhone"`
- Watch receives message and responds: `"Test response from Apple Watch"`
- Both sides log successful message exchange

### Test 3: Heartbeat Connectivity

**Objective**: Ensure periodic connectivity validation

**Steps**:
1. Launch both apps
2. Let them run for 2+ minutes
3. Monitor logs for heartbeat messages

**Expected Results**:
- Heartbeat messages sent every 30 seconds
- Logs show: `[SyncCoordinator] Heartbeat sent successfully`
- Connection maintained during idle periods

## Workout Synchronization Tests

### Test 4: Workout Session Start

- Exercise list populated correctly
- Start time matches across devices
- Shared data updated: `currentWorkoutSession` key

### Test 5: Set Completion Sync

**Objective**: Test set completion from watch to iPhone

**Watch Steps**:
1. Complete a set with specific reps/weight
2. Mark set as completed
3. Verify completion sent to iPhone

**iPhone Steps**:
1. Monitor for set completion updates
2. Verify set marked as completed in UI
3. Check persistence in SwiftData model

**Expected Results**:
- iPhone receives set completion immediately
- UI updates to reflect completed set
- Data persisted correctly in WorkoutSession model
- Pending completions cleared after successful sync

### Test 6: Timer State Synchronization

**Objective**: Verify timer sync in both directions

**iPhone-to-Watch Test**:
1. Start rest timer on iPhone (90 seconds)
2. Verify timer appears on watch
3. Pause timer on iPhone
4. Verify pause reflected on watch

**Watch-to-iPhone Test**:
1. Start timer on watch (60 seconds)
2. Verify timer appears on iPhone
3. Let timer complete on watch
4. Verify completion on iPhone

**Expected Results**:
- Timer state syncs within 1-2 seconds
- Duration and remaining time accurate
- Start/pause/stop actions reflected on both devices
- Timer completion triggers shared state update

## Error Handling and Recovery Tests

### Test 7: Connection Loss Recovery

**Objective**: Test offline operation and sync recovery

**Steps**:
1. Start workout on iPhone
2. Disable Bluetooth or move devices apart
3. Complete sets on both devices while disconnected
4. Re-establish connection
5. Verify pending operations sync

**Expected Results**:
- Apps continue functioning offline
- Pending operations queued locally
- Full sync occurs when connection restored
- No data loss or corruption
- Conflict resolution for duplicate operations

### Test 8: App Lifecycle Recovery

**Objective**: Test connectivity after app backgrounding

**Steps**:

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Log Analysis

**Key Log Categories**:
- `WatchConnectivity`: Session activation and message passing
- `Sync`: Synchronization operations and state changes
- `SharedData`: App Group data storage operations

**Important Log Messages**:
```
[WatchConnectivityManager] Session activated successfully
[SyncCoordinator] Successfully synced workoutSessionUpdate
[SharedDataManager] Stored object for key: currentWorkoutSession
[SyncCoordinator] Processed 5 pending sync events with conflict resolution
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Session not supported"
- **Solution**: Ensure running on physical device or properly paired simulator
- **Check**: WCSession.isSupported() returns true

**Issue**: "Watch app not installed"
- **Solution**: Install watch app via iPhone Watch app or Xcode
- **Check**: WCSession.default.isWatchAppInstalled

**Issue**: Messages not reaching destination
- **Solution**: Verify both apps are in foreground initially
- **Check**: WCSession.default.isReachable

**Issue**: Sync conflicts after reconnection
- **Solution**: Check pending operations queue and conflict resolution
- **Check**: SyncCoordinator.getPendingOperationsCount()

### Performance Monitoring

**Memory Usage**:
- Monitor SharedDataManager cache size
- Check for WatchConnectivity message queue buildup
- Verify proper cleanup of completed sessions

**Network Usage**:
- WatchConnectivity uses Bluetooth LE (minimal battery impact)
- Message frequency should not exceed 10 per minute in steady state
- Bulk sync operations should complete within 10 seconds
