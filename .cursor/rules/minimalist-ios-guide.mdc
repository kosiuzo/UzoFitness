# iOS Minimalist Design Philosophy for Cursor

## Core Design Principles

Apply these minimalist design principles when developing iOS applications:

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use generous white space as the primary design element
- Employ subtle gray backgrounds (`UIColor.systemGray6` or similar) to create gentle visual separation
- Minimize visual noise - every element should serve a clear purpose
- Create breathing room between components with consistent spacing (16px, 24px, 32px increments)

### Typography & Content
- Prioritize clear, readable text over decorative elements
- Use system fonts (San Francisco) for consistency and legibility
- Implement a clear information hierarchy with appropriate font weights and sizes
- Keep text concise and functional - "4 sets x 8 reps" instead of verbose descriptions

### Color Palette
- Default to a neutral color scheme with whites, light grays, and subtle accents
- Use color sparingly and purposefully (blue for interactive elements, green for completion states)
- Avoid gradients, shadows, or complex visual effects unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain high contrast for accessibility while keeping the overall aesthetic clean

### Interface Elements
- Design with clean, simple shapes and minimal ornamentation
- Use standard iOS components (circles, rounded rectangles) without heavy customization
- Implement subtle interactive states - light gray fills on tap, minimal animations
- Group related content with consistent card-based layouts and gentle borders

### Layout & Structure
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for familiar interaction patterns
- Use standard navigation patterns and system-provided UI elements
- Create consistent spacing and alignment throughout the interface
- Design with a clear content-first approach where functionality drives the visual design

### Interaction Design
- Implement smooth, subtle animations that feel natural to iOS users
- Use haptic feedback appropriately to enhance interactions without being overwhelming
- Design for thumb-friendly touch targets with adequate spacing
- Maintain consistency in interaction patterns across the entire application

## Implementation Guidelines

When building iOS interfaces, always ask:
1. Can this be simplified further?
2. Does every visual element serve the user's primary goal?
3. Is the interface immediately understandable without explanation?
4. Does it feel native to iOS while maintaining clean aesthetics?

Remember: The best interface is often the one that gets out of the user's way and lets them focus on their task efficiently.
